{"prompt": "What problem does Databricks solve?", "referenceResponse": "The business knows that there's gold in all that data, and your team's job is to find it. But being a detective with a bunch of clunky tools and difficult to setup infrastructure is hard. You want to be the hero who figures out what's going on with the business, but you're spending all your time wrestling with the tools.We built Databricks to make big data simple. Apache SparkTM made a big step towards achieving this mission by providing a unified framework for building data pipelines. Databricks takes this further by providing a zero-management cloud platform built around Spark that delivers 1) fully managed Spark clusters, 2) an interactive workspace for exploration and visualization, 3) a production pipeline scheduler, and 4) a platform for powering your favorite Spark-based applications. So instead of tackling data headaches, you can finally focus on finding answers that make an immediate impact on your business."}
{"prompt": "Who should use Databricks?", "referenceResponse": "Anyone who wants to extract value from their big data quickly and efficiently ranging from data scientists and engineers to developers and data analysts.
